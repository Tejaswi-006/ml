tension tho chasthunnanu nenu
soo first make a simple model and upload in 40 mins
nex remove  category column in each data set 
use url and label only
create a new data set on yur own by querying the dataset like find no of vowels and characters and do something and analyze the data set create a new dataset from that only then you will get good accuracy
and for sure calculate f1 score along with accuracy
